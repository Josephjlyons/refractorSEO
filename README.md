# Purpose

The purpose of this project was to take basic elements and turn them into more specfic semantics that outline what sections of code pertain to. Refractoring basic generic elements and using more specified semantic elements but also making sure they still function with the css file and all styles are applied and remain the same per customers request. 

A few errors were fixed where one clickable tab in the navbar wasnt relocating down the page to the intended article, there were no comments in either file html/css outlining what was going on, comments were added to make it more clear as to what was going on in the files. 

# Final Version

Page performs as it should and there are no changes to the overall layout of the page. A clear and more concise code was written to make it clear what was happening in both html file and css file.
